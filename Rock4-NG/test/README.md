Here, with main.cc we compare a computation with Radau5 and a computation with
Rock4.

* Radau5 is executed with increasing tolerances, starting from an unreacheable
one. The first computed solution is used as reference as it is a quasi
exact solution.

* Rock4 is run on the same problem.

and we compare the results.
