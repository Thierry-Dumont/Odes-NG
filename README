- Radau5-NG: a novel implementation of the classical Radau5 routine.

- Rodas-NG:  a novel implementation of the classical Rodas routine.

These two programs are a complete rewriting of the fortran programes of 
Hairer and Wanner
(see: Solving Ordinary Differential Equations, TII: 
      Stiff and differential-algebraic problems. 
      Springer Series in Computational Mathematics, 14.).

- Rock4: a rewriting (with as less vector copies as possible) of A. Abdulle
         code.
- Rock4-L: an implementation of the Rock method for linear and affine 
           problems du/dt= Au +B.

- SDIRKL: a generic implementation of digonally implicit RK. methods for
          linear and affine problems: du/dt=Au +B.

- SymplectikRK: an implementation of the Gaussian Runge-Kutta symplectik
                method.
- common:  classes, routines... common to Radau5-NG and  Rodas-NG.
