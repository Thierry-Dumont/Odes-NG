The source directories Radau5-\/\+N\+G, Rock4-\/\+N\+G, Rock4-\/\+L, Rodas-\/\+N\+G, S\+D\+I\+R\+K\+L and Symplectic\+R\+K contains sources of different Runge-\/\+Kutta methods written in C++.

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries  Radau5-\/\+N\+G } is a rewritting of Hairer and Wanner code, optimized, but with some \end{quote}
restrictions (see documentation).

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries  Rock4-\/\+N\+G } is a rewritting of A. Abdulle code, avoiding vector copies. \end{quote}


\begin{quote}
{\bfseries  Rock4-\/\+L } is an adaptation of Rock4 method ro linear (actually affine) \end{quote}
problems $ du/dt= A u +B.$, with $ A $ linear and $ B $ independent of $ t.$

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries  Rodas-\/\+N\+G } is a rewritting of Hairer and Wanner code, optimized, but with some \end{quote}
restrictions (see documentation).

\begin{quote}
{\bfseries  S\+D\+I\+R\+K\+L} is a generic implementation of S\+D\+I\+R\+K methods in the linear (affine) case. Thus, linear systems must be solved. \end{quote}


\begin{quote}
{\bfseries  Symplectic\+R\+K} is the (the family of) symplectic Gauss methods. \end{quote}


See documentation of individual programs.\hypertarget{index_General}{}\section{General considerations about implementation.}\label{index_General}
All is written in C++, and some program must be used with recent compilers (c++-\/11 norm). Everuthing has been tested with g++, icc and clang compilers.

This is a library of templates, no intermediate binary is created.

For all these programs, a class must be created wich describes the program to be solved.\hypertarget{index_Directory}{}\subsection{Directory structure\+:}\label{index_Directory}
\begin{quote}
{\bfseries  common/include} contains all the classes, methods and functions common to the different programs. \end{quote}


\begin{quote}
for each program, the corresponding directory contains an {\bfseries include} directory, which stores the different classes of the program and {\bfseries test} directories. \end{quote}
\hypertarget{index_test}{}\subsubsection{Test directories\+:}\label{index_test}
Each {\bfseries  test} directory contains a main program, all the necessary classes, and a cmake file. To compile and test the program\+:

\begin{quote}
Adapt C\+Make file if necessary. \end{quote}


\begin{quote}
{\bfseries cd Build} directory \end{quote}


\begin{quote}
{\bfseries cmake ..} (possibly with an option to determine the compiler you want to use); see the Cmake files provided. \end{quote}


\begin{quote}
{\bfseries  make} a {\bfseries  ./run } file is created. \end{quote}


\begin{quote}
{\bfseries run} to execute the program.\end{quote}
